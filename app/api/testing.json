He has a host of fans, not least among them, writers and actors like Stephen Fry and Simon Callow, and indeed our own Marian Keyes.\n\nMarian declares him to be \"the ultimate in comfort reading, because nothing bad ever happens in PG Wodehouse's land.\"\n\nIn the Blandings series, Emsworth struggles to keep his dysfunctional family in order but usually confuses things himself. All he wants is to be left in peace with his beloved pig The Empress, but friends, visitors, servants and spongers get in the way.\n\nJennifer Saunders stars as his indomitable sister Connie, Jack Farthing as hapless son Freddy and Mark Williams as long-suffering butler Beach. There are guest appearances from David Walliams, Paloma Faith and David Bamber.\n\nThe show was filmed at 400-year-old Crom Castle, near Newtownbutler in Northern Ireland, home of Lord Erne.\n\nThere have been some spiffing PG Wodehouse series in the past, yet his achingly funny Blandings stories have been mostly overlooked. This high-spirited adaptation see Timothy Spall as fuddle-headed pig-fancier Lord Emsworth and Jennifer Saunders as his terrifying sister Lady Constance. Plum purists may snort at liberties taken with the opener Pig-Hoo-o-o-o-ey! but its tale of a porcine hunger-strike and frustrated young love is Wodehouse to a T.","runtime":30,"network":"BBC One","air_day":"Sunday","air_day_localized":"Sunday","air_day_utc":"Sunday","air_time":"6:30pm","air_time_localized":"6:30pm","air_time_utc":"10:30am","certification":"","imdb_id":"tt2211457","tvdb_id":"265392","tvrage_id":"33853","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/20766.10.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/20766.10.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/20766.10.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":66,"votes":10,"loved":8,"hated":2},"genres":["Comedy"]},"episode":{"season":2,"number":7,"title":"The Custody of the Pumpkin","overview":"Connie plans to marry Freddie off to Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe's unusual niece; but with the Fat Pumpkin prize at stake, Clarence resolves to scupper the marriage and vanquish Parsloe once and for all.

Sadly, thousands of these unsuspecting homeowners instead become victims, duped and abandoned by the contractors they trusted their savings to and left with either unfinished or danger-laden, uninhabitable homes due to poor craftsmanship. Host and master carpenter Adam Carolla and his team, consisting of no-nonsense, expert contractor Skip Bedell and his wife, private investigator Alison Bedell, are on a mission to track down these shady, evasive contractors and drag them back to the scene of the crime to face the music and fix the disasters they left behind. Eleven half-hour episodes of \"Catch A Contractor\" debut starting Sunday, March 9 at 10PM ET/PT with two back-to-back new episodes on Spike TV. Home improvement scams have consistently ranked in the Better Business Bureau's top 10 consumer cons. Carolla, who spent 10 years working in construction before his successful career in radio and television, takes this issue very personally. As a passionate master carpenter who has built hundreds of homes including his own, he not only has a keen eye when it comes to identifying shoddy, inferior work, but loathes seeing trusting and na\u00efve average citizens getting scammed by subpar contractors and left holding the proverbial bag.","runtime":30,"network":"Spike TV","air_day":"Sunday","air_day_localized":"Sunday","air_day_utc":"Sunday","air_time":"10:00pm","air_time_localized":"10:00pm","air_time_utc":"7:00pm","certification":"","imdb_id":"tt3108438","tvdb_id":"279033","tvrage_id":"37007","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/32902.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/32902.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/32902.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":90,"votes":1,"loved":1,"hated":0},"genres":["Reality"]},"episode":{"season":1,"number":5,"title":"Fooled by the Floyds","overview":"An abandoned home leaves the homeowners and their baby in danger; discovering the real truth.","url":"http://trakt.tv/show/catch-a-contractor/season/1/episode/5","first_aired":1396242000,"first_aired_iso":"2014-03-30T22:00:00-04:00","first_aired_localized":1396242000,"first_aired_utc":1396231200,"images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/32902-940.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":0,"votes":0,"loved":0,"hated":0}}},{"show":{"title":"Chopped","year":2009,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/chopped","first_aired":1231912800,"first_aired_iso":"2009-01-13T22:00:00-05:00","first_aired_localized":1231912800,"first_aired_utc":1231902000,"country":"United States","overview":"Hosted by Ted Allen, Chopped is a high energy, fast paced cooking competition that challenges four up-and-coming chefs to turn a selection of everyday ingredients into an extraordinary three-course meal.

Under his leadership, Human Rights Watch has gone global, growing ten-fold in size and vastly expanding its reach. It now operates in more than 90 countries, among them some of the most dangerous and oppressed places on Earth.\n\nDuring Kenneth\u2019s tenure, Human Rights Watch has worked to bring justice to victims of the worst abuses, documenting war crimes from Bosnia to Congo and from Iraq to Sierra Leone, testifying at international tribunals, pushing to create the International Criminal Court, and helping to hold to account Liberian dictator Charles Taylor, Peru\u2019s Alberto Fujimori and Serbia\u2019s Slobodan Milosevic, among others, for crimes against humanity. Hard-nosed advocacy laid the groundwork for international treaties banning landmines, cluster munitions, and child soldiers.\n\nUnder Kenneth 's leadership, Human Rights Watch has expanded its work on the rights of women, children, refugees, and migrant workers, bringing a human rights perspective to such issues as domestic violence, trafficking, rape as a war crime, and child soldiers. It has helped spotlight previously ignored topics such as the rights of gays and lesbians and, prompted by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the link between health and human rights.\n\nKenneth joined Human Rights Watch in 1987 as deputy director. His initial work centred on Haiti, which was just emerging from the Duvalier dictatorship but continued to be plagued by brutal military rule. He has written extensively on a range of human rights issues, with more than 160 articles and chapters to his name, devoting special attention to issues of international justice, counter-terrorism, the foreign policies of the major powers, and the work of the United Nations.\n\n-- Tim Wilson\n\nTim Wilson, well known for many years as a conservative commentator with the Institute of Public Affairs, became the centre of controversy late last year when appointed by Attorney-General George Brandis to the Human Rights Commission \u2013 a body the IPA has long sought to have abolished.\n\nTim was named freedom commissioner, tasked by the AG with preserving freedom of the speech, freedom of the press and artistic freedom. He is particularly opposed to section 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act, under which commentator Andrew Bolt was found guilty in 2009.\n\nPreviously Tim was the Director of Climate Change Policy and the IP (intellectual property) and Free Trade Unit at the IPA and a Senior Fellow at New York's Centre for Medicine in the Public Interest.\n\nIn 2009 he was named by The Australian newspaper as one of the ten emerging leaders of Australian society.\n\nHe has previously worked in consulting and international aid and development, as well as for a number of State and Federal Members of Parliament. He was also twice elected President and Chairman of the Monash University Student Union and was also elected to the Council of Monash University. He completed a Masters of Diplomacy and Trade from the Monash Graduate School of Business and a Bachelor of Arts from Monash University. He has several international diplomas and is a trained carbon accountant.\n\nTim is a member of a large number of civil society organisations, including the Australian-American Association, the Australian Institute of International Affairs, Melbourne Football Club, Melbourne Cricket Club and the National Gallery of Victoria.\n\n-- Mona Eltahawy\n\nMona Eltahawy is an award-winning columnist and an international public speaker on Arab and Muslim issues.

Her opinion pieces have been published frequently in The Washington Post and the International Herald Tribune and she has appeared as a guest analyst in several media outlets.\n\nBefore she moved to the US in 2000 Mona was a news reporter in the Middle East for many years. She was the first Egyptian journalist to live and to work for a western news agency in Israel.\n\nMona is a lecturer and researcher on the growing importance of social media in the Arab world. She has taught as an adjunct at the New School in New York, the University of Oklahoma and the UN-mandated University for Peace in Costa Rica.\n\nMona was born in Egypt in 1967 and has lived in the UK, Saudi Arabia and Israel. She calls herself a proud liberal Muslim. In 2005 she was named a Muslim Leader of Tomorrow by the American Society for Muslim Advancement and she is a member of the Communications Advisory Group for Musawah, the global movement for justice and equality in the Muslim family.\n\n-- Lucy Siegle\n\nLucy Siegle is a UK journalist with The Observer who specialises in environmental issues and ethical consumerism. \n\nIn 2004 she created the paper\u2019s Observer Ethical Awards (OEAs), dubbed the Green Oscars, which have been running for over eight years.\n\nLucy has worked across all UK channels on different formats and themes, but her connection to The One Show has been her most high-profile vehicle. She has used her knowledge and experience to present hundreds of films on subjects ranging from the popularity of naked photoshoots to rescuing trout. \n\nIn September 2012 she directed and produced Green Cut, a lauded fashion short film on sustainable style, and she has published a book called To Die For: is fashion wearing out the world? which explores the issue of the need for reform in the fashion industry. This substantive book on the humanitarian and environmental fall out of the fashion industry, was longlisted for the UK's prestigious non-fiction prize, The Orwell Prize. \n\nLucy and Livia Firth founded the Green Carpet Challenge. Together they have worked extensively with some of the biggest names in the fashion arena to bring the issue of sustainable style to mainstream fashion events \u2013 namely and most impressively the Oscars.\n\n-- Ilwad Elman\n\nIlwad (Elle) Elman runs the Elman Peace and Human Rights Centre in Mogadishu with her mother, Fartun. \n\nHer father was an ardent peace activist in the 1990s, spreading the mantra \"Put down the gun, pick up the pen\" around Somalia.

In the Northwest, many credible people swear to have sighted Bigfoot. Near Lake Champlain, locals have sworn up and down to seeing a strange, prehistoric-like creature in the water. And down south in the swamplands, it\u2019s no different\u2013some of the most deep-rooted and fearsome monster stories have endured. In the new original series Cryptid: The Swamp Beast, one of America\u2019s oldest mysteries and bone-chilling legends comes to life through dramatizations, eyewitness accounts, real news reports and expert interviews.\n\nIn a remote southern town, the past few years have brought a dramatic uptick in strange occurrences, but now, whatever has been lurking in the swamps is intruding into human territory. There have been a rash of cattle mutilations and pets being snatched away from backyards. With the attacks not matching up forensically with any known predators, suspicions have spread. Terrified residents claim to have seen signs of voodoo and are conjuring up old Cajun legends like the \u201cRougarou,\u201d a mythical shape-shifter, as a possible culprit. Others swear they\u2019ve seen a huge, bipedal creature locally known as a \u201cskunk ape\u201d lurking about at night.\n\nThe series follows a small animal-control business that responds to various calls and sightings and a deputy sheriff who believes the real culprit is some twisted individual deep in the swamp. As the weeks pass, the sightings intensify and even the most skeptical people in town begin to wonder if its darkest legends, and their worst fears, have in fact come to life.\n\nCryptid: The Swamp Beast mixes legends with eyewitness accounts and crafts them into an entertaining and scary fictional story that speaks to America\u2019s macabre history of folklore. It features startling real interviews with those who believe the legends, and have seen strange things with their own eyes. Folklore experts, biologists and original news clips play throughout each episode as well to add further real-world context.","runtime":60,"network":"History","air_day":"Monday","air_day_localized":"Monday","air_day_utc":"Monday","air_time":"10:00pm","air_time_localized":"10:00pm","air_time_utc":"7:00pm","certification":"","imdb_id":"tt3552654","tvdb_id":"278894","tvrage_id":"40893","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/32540.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart-dark.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/32540.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":90,"votes":2,"loved":2,"hated":0},"genres":["Mystery","Special Interest"]},"episode":{"season":1,"number":6,"title":"The Bayou Beast","overview":"","url":"http://trakt.tv/show/cryptid-the-swamp-beast/season/1/episode/6","first_aired":1396328400,"first_aired_iso":"2014-03-31T22:00:00-04:00","first_aired_localized":1396328400,"first_aired_utc":1396317600,"images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episode-dark.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":0,"votes":0,"loved":0,"hated":0}}},{"show":{"title":"God's Gift - 14 Days","year":2014,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/gods-gift-14-days","first_aired":1392703200,"first_aired_iso":"2014-02-17T22:00:00+09:00","first_aired_localized":1392703200,"first_aired_utc":1392642000,"country":"South Korea","overview":"Kim Soo Hyun experiences the unfathomable when her daughter is kidnapped and murdered.

Uta passionately wanted to know more about these children, and they inspired her to dedicate the rest of her career to studying the autistic mind.\n\nOn the eve of National Autism Day, Horizon reveals how Uta's lifetime study of people with autism has transformed our understanding of this mysterious condition.\n\nIn this film Uta shows how people with autism perceive and interact with the world and how, for them, another kind of reality exists. She meets people with autism who have extraordinary talents, and explains why they often fail to understand jokes. She also explores whether many of us could be just a little bit autistic.","url":"http://trakt.tv/show/horizon/season/2014/episode/6","first_aired":1396411200,"first_aired_iso":"2014-04-01T21:00:00+01:00","first_aired_localized":1396411200,"first_aired_utc":1396382400,"images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/726-2014-6.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":0,"votes":0,"loved":0,"hated":0}}},{"show":{"title":"J\u00e4tteb\u00e4stisar","year":2014,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/jttebstisar","first_aired":1395201600,"first_aired_iso":"2014-03-18T21:00:00+01:00","first_aired_localized":1395201600,"first_aired_utc":1395172800,"country":"Sweden","overview":"","runtime":30,"network":"TV4","air_day":"Tuesday","air_day_localized":"Tuesday","air_day_utc":"Tuesday","air_time":"9:00pm","air_time_localized":"9:00pm","air_time_utc":"1:00pm","certification":"","imdb_id":"","tvdb_id":"279733","tvrage_id":"41565","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/33169.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/33169.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/33169.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":0,"votes":0,"loved":0,"hated":0},"genres":["Comedy","Drama"]},"episode":{"season":1,"number":3,"title":"","overview":"","url":"http://trakt.tv/show/jttebstisar/season/1/episode/3","first_aired":1396411200,"first_aired_iso":"2014-04-01T21:00:00+02:00","first_aired_localized":1396411200,"first_aired_utc":1396378800,"images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/33169-940.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":0,"votes":0,"loved":0,"hated":0}}},{"show":{"title":"NCIS: Los Angeles","year":2009,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/ncis-los-angeles","first_aired":1253678400,"first_aired_iso":"2009-09-22T21:00:00-04:00","first_aired_localized":1253678400,"first_aired_utc":1253667600,"country":"United States","overview":"NCIS: Los Angeles is a drama about the high stakes world of undercover surveillance at the Office of Special Projects (OSP), a division of NCIS that is charged with apprehending dangerous and elusive criminals that pose a threat to the nation's security, specifically Naval and Marine assets and personnel.","runtime":45,"network":"CBS","air_day":"Tuesday","air_day_localized":"Tuesday","air_day_utc":"Tuesday","air_time":"9:00pm","air_time_localized":"9:00pm","air_time_utc":"6:00pm","certification":"TV-14","imdb_id":"tt1378167","tvdb_id":"95441","tvrage_id":"21934","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/116.14.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/116.14.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/116.14.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":77,"votes":1296,"loved":1087,"hated":209},"genres":["Action","Adventure","Drama"]},"episode":{"season":5,"number":19,"title":"Spoils of War ","overview":"After learning that Special Agent Kensi Blye disappeared and the Taliban may be he holding her captive, Hetty sends the NCIS: LA team to Afghanistan on a rescue mission.","url":"http://trakt.tv/show/ncis-los-angeles/season/5/episode/19","first_aired":1396411200,"first_aired_iso":"2014-04-01T21:00:00-04:00","first_aired_localized":1396411200,"first_aired_utc":1396400400,"images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/116-940.14.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":0,"votes":0,"loved":0,"hated":0}}},{"show":{"title":"Quarks & Co","year":1993,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/quarks-and-co","first_aired":734846400,"first_aired_iso":"1993-04-14T21:00:00-04:00","first_aired_localized":734846400,"first_aired_utc":734835600,"country":null,"overview":"","runtime":45,"network":"WDR","air_day":"Wednesday","air_day_localized":"Wednesday","air_day_utc":"Wednesday","air_time":"9:00pm","air_time_localized":"9:00pm","air_time_utc":"6:00pm","certification":"","imdb_id":"tt0205678","tvdb_id":"96971","tvrage_id":"0","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/10665.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/10665.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/10665.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":100,"votes":1,"loved":1,"hated":0},"genres":["Documentary"]},"episode":{"season":2014,"number":5,"title":"","overview":"","url":"http://trakt.tv/show/quarks-and-co/season/2014/episode/5","first_aired":1396411200,"first_aired_iso":"2014-04-01T21:00:00-04:00","first_aired_localized":1396411200,"first_aired_utc":1396400400,"images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/10665-940.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":0,"votes":0,"loved":0,"hated":0}}},{"show":{"title":"Shetland","year":2013,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/shetland","first_aired":1362974400,"first_aired_iso":"2013-03-10T21:00:00+00:00","first_aired_localized":1362974400,"first_aired_utc":1362949200,"country":"United Kingdom","overview":"When a young archaeologist discovers a set of human remains, the Shetland community is intrigued to know if it\u2019s an ancient find or a contemporary mystery.

The film made a huge impact - showcasing the radical and effective juvenile intervention program that took place in a New Jersey prison. Since they were created, both the prison program and the film have turned countless kids away from drugs, violence and crime. The power of the original \"Scared Straight!\" program has inspired dozens of inmate-run intervention programs in men's and women's prisons across the country; and this series will showcase several of them. Under the auspices of Arnold Shapiro, \"Beyond Scared Straight\" profiles the new approach to keeping today's kids from becoming tomorrow's convicts.\n\nMuch like the original version of \"Scared Straight!,\" these youthful offender programs put boys and girls of all ethnicities, ranging in age from 13-18, into intensive one-day in-prison sessions that show them the realities of life behind bars. However, in many dramatic ways, these 21st Century programs are very different from the original because today's youth needs a different approach. For current teens, city streets can be as dangerous as the life they believe exists behind bars. TV, film and music have glorified the gang and prison experience and the task of \"scaring\" teens is more complicated now than ever. As a result, inmates have had to adapt their methods - making them more a combination of intimidation, information and communication - and the results for the new program have proven to be equally effective.\n\nEach 60-minute episode of \"Beyond Scared Straight\" will focus on a different prison program in the U.S., following 4 -5 at-risk teens. Viewers will follow them as they attend the program, experience their intensive one-day in-prison session and then follow up with them one-month later to see the lasting impressions the program has left on them.","runtime":60,"network":"A&E","air_day":"Thursday","air_day_localized":"Thursday","air_day_utc":"Thursday","air_time":"10:00pm","air_time_localized":"10:00pm","air_time_utc":"7:00pm","certification":"TV-MA","imdb_id":"tt1707374","tvdb_id":"219331","tvrage_id":"27203","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/3526.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/3526.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/3526.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":73,"votes":17,"loved":14,"hated":3},"genres":["Reality"]},"episode":{"season":6,"number":6,"title":"Oklahoma County, Okla.:  Teen Father?","overview":"Two brothers and a sister on a rampage of crime and violence are separated after being admitted to an Oklahoma jail.","url":"http://trakt.tv/show/beyond-scared-straight/season/6/episode/6","first_aired":1396674000,"first_aired_iso":"2014-04-04T22:00:00-04:00","first_aired_localized":1396674000,"first_aired_utc":1396663200,"images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/3526-940.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":0,"votes":0,"loved":0,"hated":0}}},{"show":{"title":"Blue Bloods","year":2010,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/blue-bloods","first_aired":1285390800,"first_aired_iso":"2010-09-24T22:00:00-04:00","first_aired_localized":1285390800,"first_aired_utc":1285380000,"country":"United States","overview":"The Reagans are a multi-generational family dedicated to the New York City Police Department.
